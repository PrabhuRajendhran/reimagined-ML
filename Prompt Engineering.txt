	Prompting :
	
		Prompts (Text Inputs) -> LLM -> Response
	
	Methods :
	
		Zero Shot : No example + Only Prompt -> LLM -> Response
		
		Few Shot : Few examples + Prompt -> LLM -> Response
		
		Chain Of Thought :
		
			Zero Shot : No example + Only Prompt [with Let's think steps by step] -> LLM -> Response
			
			Few Shot : Few examples with reasoning chains + new question -> LLM -> Response
			
			Auto CoT : Auto generate reasoning chains for questions in each cluster + new question -> LLM -> Response
				- Aims to eliminate the manual effort in providing reasoning chain examples for Few Shot CoT.
				- 2 step approach :
					- question clustering
					- representative sampling from each question clustering and generate its reasoning chain using the below
						- Zero shot CoT [add "Let's think step by step" template]
						- provide simple heuristics : length of tokens, number of heuristic steps.
			
			Self Consistency
				- Aims to replace the greedy decoding used in CoT prompting
				  How?
				  Sample multiple diverse reasoning paths through Few Shot CoT
				  and, use the generations to select the most consistent answer.
