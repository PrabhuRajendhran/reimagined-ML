Roadmap 

Text Representation
	- BoW
	- TFIDF
	- word2vec
	- FastText
	- GLoVE
	- ELMo
	- BERT
	- sBERT
	

Similarity 

	- Dot product
	- cosine similarity
	- Embed endpoints from : 
		HF
		SBERT
		Cohere
		OpenAI
		
Semantic Search
	- symmetric search
	- asymmetric search
			- exact search 
				- on the fly
				- storing corpus embeddings in a vector/normal database and fetching on the fly
			- approximate search
	- Retrieve[using lexical or semantic - exact search or ann search] and Re-Rank
	
Zero Shot Classification

	- latent embedding approach
	- cloze task
	- LM To Q&A
	- Natural Language Inference (NLI) approach
